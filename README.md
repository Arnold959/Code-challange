# Code challlange lab
## learning goals
* Practice writing `if...else if...else` statements.
* Practice writing functions

## Introduction

We've learned about functions and `if...else if...else` statements built in to JavaScript. Now it's time to practice what
we've learned.

If you haven't already, fork and clone this lab into your local environment.
Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisite
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.
2. Use Javascript to write down the solution.
3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.
4. Submit the repository link for grading.
5. Ensure your repository has a well-written README.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges


Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
